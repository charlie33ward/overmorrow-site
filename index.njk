        Each mech will equip two hand weapons and one shoulder weapon. Mech combat will require fast multiple-weapon combat and cooldown management. Heavier and slower mechs will have access to more powerful and long-ranged weaponry.

        Enemies will include large insect grunt enemies, flying helicopters, high-damage rocket grunt units, medium-sized assault rifle robots, and large boss enemies.
