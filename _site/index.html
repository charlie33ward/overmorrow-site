        There are three planned mech suits: a fast, mobile suit focusing on close-range encounters and rapid dodging, a long-range flying suit that is weak up close, and a heavy-weight, fast tank suit with slow rotation requiring strategic combat planning.

        Each mech will equip two hand weapons and one shoulder weapon. Mech combat will require fast multiple-weapon combat and cooldown management. Heavier and slower mechs will have access to more powerful and long-ranged weaponry.

        Enemies will include large insect grunt enemies, flying helicopters, high-damage rocket grunt units, medium-sized assault rifle robots, and large boss enemies.
